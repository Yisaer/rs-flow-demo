//! Stream processor trait and common utilities

//! Defines the core StreamProcessor interface and shared utilities for all processors.
//! 
//! Redesigned to use StreamData::Control signals for all control operations,

/// Core trait for all stream processors
/// 
/// Processors run in their own tokio task and handle data flow through broadcast channels.
/// They can receive data from multiple upstream sources and broadcast to multiple downstream sinks.
/// 
/// Design pattern:
/// 1. Constructor takes configuration and input receivers
/// 2. `start()` method spawns tokio task and returns ProcessorView
/// 3. Each processor implements data processing routine with tokio::select!
/// 4. Supports graceful shutdown via StreamData::Control signals
/// 5. Handles multiple input sources and output broadcasting
/// 
/// Note: This trait is designed to work with both PhysicalPlan-based processors
/// and special-purpose processors like ControlSourceProcessor and ResultSinkProcessor

    /// Start the processor and return a view for control and output
    /// 
    /// This method should:
    /// 1. Create necessary channels (result channel only, no stop channel)
    /// 2. Spawn a tokio task for the processor routine
    /// 3. Return a ProcessorView for external control and data consumption
    /// 
    /// Processors should listen for StreamData::Control(ControlSignal::StreamEnd) 
    /// in their main processing loop to handle graceful shutdown.
